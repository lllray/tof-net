
% This function computes the final depth, given individual phases and the
% vector of frequencies. Also, given as input is the depth range - which is
% the set of possible depth values. Essentially it's doing phase unwrapping
% from multi-freq measurements. Somehow using 6 freqs from 10:30:160 was
% insufficient and led to a few outliers, since the method processes each 
% pixel individually. Finer freqs (more phaseImgs) helps disambiguate.
